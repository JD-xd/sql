# MySQL Bookstore Project 

Problem Statement
The provided database schema for a books table is a foundational component of a retail bookstore's backend system. The challenge is to leverage this schema to build a robust and functional MySQL project that provides valuable insights into the bookstore's inventory and sales data. The primary problems to solve are data retrieval, analysis, and reporting to support business operations and decision-making.    
The current schema, while useful for storing book details, lacks the functionality for deeper analysis. The raw data needs to be processed to answer key business questions, such as:    
â€¢	Which books are bestsellers? ðŸ’°    
â€¢	How does pricing affect sales and availability?    
â€¢	Are certain categories more popular than others? ðŸ“Š    
â€¢	How do customer reviews correlate with a book's price and availability?    
The project needs to address these questions by designing and executing a series of MySQL queries that transform the raw data into actionable intelligence. The project will also need to handle data integrity and consistency, ensuring the data is accurate for all reporting purposes.
